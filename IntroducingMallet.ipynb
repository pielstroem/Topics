    "# Topics – Easy Topic Modeling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The text mining technique **Topic Modeling** has become a popular statistical method for clustering documents. This [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) introduces a step-by-step workflow, basically containing data preprocessing, the actual topic modeling using **latent Dirichlet allocation** (LDA), which learns the relationships between words, topics, and documents, as well as some interactive visualizations to explore the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA, introduced in the context of text analysis in [2003](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf), is an instance of a more general class of models called **mixed-membership models**. Involving a number of distributions and parameters, the topic model is typically performed using [Gibbs sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling) with conjugate priors and is purely based on word frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been written numerous introductions to topic modeling for humanists (e.g. [this one](http://scottbot.net/topic-modeling-for-humanists-a-guided-tour/)), which provide another level of detail regarding its technical and epistemic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workflow, you will need a corpus (a set of texts) as plain text (`.txt`) or [TEI XML](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) (`.xml`). Using the `dariah_topics` package, you also have the ability to process the output of [DARIAH-DKPro-Wrapper](https://github.com/DARIAH-DE/DARIAH-DKPro-Wrapper), a command-line tool for *natural language processing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling works best with very large corpora. The [TextGrid Repository](https://textgridrep.org/) is a great place to start searching for text data. Anyway, to demonstrate the technique, we provide one small text collection in the folder `grenzboten_sample` containing 15 diary excerpts, as well as 15 war diary excerpts, which appeared in *Die Grenzboten*, a German newspaper of the late 19th and early 20th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Of course, you can work with your own corpus in this notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're relying on the LDA implementation by [Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/), called [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php), which is known to be very robust. Aside from that, we provide two more Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [IntroducingMallet](IntroducingGensim.ipynb), using LDA by [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/project/gensim/), which is attractive because of its multi-core support.\n",
    "* [IntroducingLda](IntroducingLda.ipynb), using LDA by [lda](http://pythonhosted.org/lda/index.html), which is very lightweight.\n",
    "\n",

    "## First step: Installing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To work within this Jupyter notebook, you will have to import the `dariah_topics` library. As you do, `dariah_topics` also imports a couple of external libraries, which have to be installed first. `pip` is the preferred installer program in Python. Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary installers. If you are interested in `pip`, have a look at [this website](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the ability to install dependencies via `pip` from within this notebook. To get a feeling for working with Jupyter, copy and paste (or best: type) the following code snippet in the empty cell below and press the **Run**-button.\n",
    "\n",

    "import pip\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get any errors or are not able to install *all* dependencies properly, try [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pip) for troubleshooting or create a new issue on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/DARIAH-DE/Topics).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Furthermore**, you will have to install MALLET, or at least [download](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php), unzip and specifiy the path to the unzipped folder further below."
